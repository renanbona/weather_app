# Weather App
Weather app is just the result of a quick study of vanilla javascript

### While I was building this app I've had to study/review some javascript concepts, like:
* querySelector
* addEventListener
* template literals
* asynchronous function
* ES6 destructuring
* regex
* navigator.geolocation

It's important to remind this project uses https://github.com/darkskyapp/skycons and https://darksky.net/dev
 
The html and the css created for this project were very simple, because they weren't the focus of this application. So, sorry If
your eyes get burn when see this ugly creature.
